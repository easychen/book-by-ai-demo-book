# Promoting Engagement and Company Culture



Managing a remote team comes with unique challenges when it comes to maintaining company culture, promoting engagement, and helping employees feel connected. Without the organic social interactions that come with working in an office, managers have to be more intentional about building relationships and boosting morale across distributed teams. The good news is there are many creative solutions and activities you can implement to unite your remote workforce.

### Host virtual social events 

One of the most direct ways to engage remote employees and bring people together is by organizing virtual events. These could be purely social gatherings or combined with other activities like trivia, games, contests, etc. The key is picking events that align with your company culture and give people a chance to mingle and have fun. For example, you could host:

- **Virtual happy hours** - Gather at the end of the week over video chat to toast accomplishments and kick off the weekend. Send everyone a fun cocktail recipe or snack recommendation to create a shared experience.  

- **Lunch & learns** - During the midday lull, organize talks where employees can learn new skills while eating lunch together virtually.

- **Virtual game nights** - Host trivia, bingo, Pictionary, or other games over video chat to spark some friendly competition. 

- **Online classes** - From mediation to mixology, organize virtual classes led by team members or outside experts. This helps people bond over shared interests and expand their horizons.

- **Remote movie/TV watch parties** - Services like Netflix Party, Hulu Watch Party, and Prime Video Watch Party allow groups to sync up remotely and watch and chat together.

- **Video coffee breaks** - Schedule short virtual coffee breaks so employees can connect more casually and catch up on life outside of work.

- **Virtual office tours** - Give remote employees a peek into headquarters or into each other's home offices by sharing photos, videos, or live tours. 

- **Remote team outings** - Order everyone the same meal kit or snack box and cook a virtual meal together. Or mail care packages with items to use on a shared virtual outing like bingo.

The key is mixing up events so there's always something new and engaging on the calendar. Be sure to promote the events in advance and send reminders so employees remember to join. Recording events allows those who can't attend live to still feel included.

### Foster casual connections  

In addition to organized events, also help facilitate more casual social interactions among remote employees. This helps people forge bonds and prevents a sense of isolation:

- Set up a #random channel in your chat tool for silly jokes, pet photos, interesting articles, and off-topic fun. 

- Ask a light "watercooler question" like "What's your favorite holiday tradition?" at the start of meetings to spark conversation.

- Share photos from company events or milestones over chat so remote folks don't feel left out.

- Create interest-based chat groups around hobbies, sports teams, TV shows etc. so people can connect over shared passions.

- Rotate " remote coffee roulette" where two random employees are paired up weekly to meet over video for a casual chat.

- Maintain a virtual "wall of fame" to recognize employees for accomplishments, work anniversaries, birthdays, new pets and more.

Even small efforts to socialize and chat casually online make a big difference in helping remote employees feel connected, engaged, and part of the team.

### Reinforce company values virtually

Your company's values and culture should be infused through all of your remote workforce initiatives - not just social activities but also policies, procedures, and programs. Some ideas include:

- Start meetings by reading company values and mission statement.

- Highlight examples of employees demonstrating company values. 

- Create value-focused employee recognition programs.

- Develop virtual onboarding that teaches company culture through games and activities.

- Share stories and videos highlighting your culture and values via email, chat, intranet.

- Discuss values and culture during remote check-ins between managers and reports.

- Infuse core values into your remote performance management process.

Reinforcing values consistently ensures organizational culture remains strong even when working distributed. Remote employees will feel aligned with company goals and connected to a shared purpose.

### Listen and gather feedback

Don't assume you know how to best engage remote employees. Instead, make it a habit to ask for input and feedback. Conduct regular surveys to gauge morale, engagement levels, and culture sentiment across remote teams. Ask what activities and initiatives people find most meaningful and enjoyable. Be receptive to suggestions for improvements. And most importantly, take action on the feedback to enhance how your company engages and unites distributed teams. Listening demonstrates you value remote perspectives and care about continually improving processes.

With creativity and commitment to connecting employees in meaningful ways, leaders can cultivate a thriving culture and high engagement across distributed teams. Don't underestimate the power of virtual events, casual social interactions, and frequent communication to unite your remote workforce.
