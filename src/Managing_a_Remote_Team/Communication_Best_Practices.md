# Communication Best Practices



Effective communication is essential for remote teams to collaborate productively and build trust. With team members distributed across locations, thoughtful communication strategies help bridge the physical divide. Here are some best practices for enabling seamless communication in a remote team:

**Establish Multiple Communication Channels**

Remote teams should leverage various communication channels like email, chat, project management tools, and video conferencing. This provides different options for quick questions, detailed discussions, status updates, and face-to-face interactions. Channels like Slack or Teams for instant messaging and Zoom or Google Meet for video calls are very popular. 

**Define Channel Purposes**  

Clarify the right mediums for specific topics to prevent miscommunication. For example, use email for formal announcements, chat for quick questions, project tools for task collaboration, and meetings for brainstorming sessions. Explicit guidelines help team members choose the right channel.

**Document Decisions**

Remote conversations can be disjointed across time zones. So, document all key decisions in a shared place like project management tools or team wikis. This retains clarity on outcomes, rationale, and next steps for the whole team. 

**Enable Time Zone Overlaps**

Find a reasonable overlap across team member time zones for core collaboration hours. This allows real-time communication and meetings when required. Outside these hours, asynchronous channels like chat and emails enable non-blocking conversations. 

**Communicate Context in Writing** 

Written communication lacks facial expressions and tone. So, be explicit about intent, explain background, and clarify expectations in messages. Use emoji or gifs to convey emotion where suitable. Follow up on ambiguities over a quick call.

**Establish Etiquette Norms**

Define communication etiquettes like responding within 24 hours, avoiding last-minute meeting invites, using video for complex discussions, and indicating urgency appropriately. Such norms foster respectful interactions. 

**Send Regular Status Updates**  

Since remote workers cannot check in casually at a desk, proactively share status updates via standups, ship updates, sprint demos, or weekly syncs. This maintains visibility despite the distance.

**Enable Informal Conversations**

Watercooler chat enables bonding beyond work topics. Allocate time for open discussions in meetings or create informal chat channels/virtual hangouts for team members to socialize. 

**Communicate During Onboarding**

Have new members introduce themselves and share their experience over video calls. Assign buddies to help them learn communication norms and processes. Conduct virtual tea sessions for them to interact informally. 

**Emphasize Inclusivity**

Encourage all team members to speak up during discussions. Draw out quieter members by directly asking for opinions. Be cognizant of diverse cultural communication styles. 

**Provide Feedback Regularly**

Give context-specific feedback aligned with team goals through one-on-ones, retrospectives, and peer feedback. Positive feedback recognizes good work, while constructive feedback enables improvement.

**Listen Actively**

Practice active listening during conversations through positive body language, avoiding interruptions, asking clarifying questions and summarizing key points. This makes team members feel heard. 

**Lead by Example**

Managers should exemplify healthy communication practices like responding promptly, documenting discussions, and sharing status proactively. This sets the right precedents for others to emulate.

With intentional planning and commitment to healthy interactions, remote teams can build trust and align effectively across distances through seamless communication. The strategies above help avoid misalignment from ineffective conversations in distributed teams.
