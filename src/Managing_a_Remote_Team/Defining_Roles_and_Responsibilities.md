# Defining Roles and Responsibilities

For a remote team to function efficiently, it is crucial that each member has a clear understanding of their role and responsibilities. When people work remotely, the lack of in-person interactions can often blur job duties, so managers need to be extra thorough in defining roles upfront. Here are some tips for delineating responsibilities for remote staff:

**Identify core team roles.** Most remote teams share some common positions like a team lead, project manager, developers, designers, etc. Think about the structure that makes the most sense for your group's objectives and resources. Outline the typical responsibilities for each of those core roles on the team. For example, the project manager typically oversees deadlines, budgets and day-to-day progress. 

**Customize roles around member strengths.** While certain duties may be standard for a position, you can customize responsibilities around each individual's strengths, skills and interests. Maybe you have two developers with different specialities - one focused on front-end, the other on back-end. Or a designer who prefers graphic design versus another who likes animation. Tailor their roles so they can do what they do best.

**Provide detailed role descriptions.** For each team member's position, write up a clear description that covers:
- Primary responsibilities and day-to-day tasks
- Key skills and experience required 
- Who they report to and key contacts 
- Expected deliverables and deadlines
- Any special projects outside their routine work

**Set expectations for teamwork.** Collaboration is essential on remote teams. Make sure role descriptions emphasize shared goals and the need to communicate and assist others. For example, designers help developers bring concepts to life, developers provide feedback to improve designs. 

**Re-evaluate as needs change.** As projects progress, responsibilities may shift or increase. Check in periodically with staff to realign roles and workloads if needed. Monitor for signs of burnout.

**Share examples of success.** Job duties can feel vague, so share models of excellence. Show what success looks like in terms of key deliverables, timeframes and quality measures. Offer examples from current or past team members.  

With well-defined roles and responsibilities, remote teams can stay coordinated and productive. Each member understands how their work fits into the big picture. They know what to prioritize to reach individual and collective goals. Clear expectations upfront prevent confusion down the road.
