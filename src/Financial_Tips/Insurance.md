# Insurance

As a digital nomad, having proper insurance coverage is crucial for protecting your finances and peace of mind as you travel the world working remotely. Since digital nomads frequently move between countries and jurisdictions, getting the right insurance can be tricky. Here are some tips on the key types of insurance digital nomads need.

## Health Insurance

One of the most complex issues for U.S.-based digital nomads is finding affordable international health insurance. Many nomads opt to go without comprehensive health insurance to save money, instead getting basic travel medical insurance policies that cover emergencies. While tempting, this is very risky in case you have a major medical issue or accident abroad. 

There are a few good options for long-term international health insurance for digital nomads:

- **International insurance companies** like Cigna and Bupa offer plans that cover you globally. This is the most comprehensive option.

- **Geo-specific regional insurers** like SafetyWing offer affordable coverage for digital nomads spending time in specific regions like Europe.

- **Alternative programs** like healthcare sharing ministries can offer cheaper coverage, but may have more exclusions.

I opted for a global plan from Cigna that gives me robust coverage worldwide. The premium is not cheap at $300 per month, but gives me peace of mind that any health issues will be covered wherever I roam. Having a sense of humor helps too - I joke that my health insurance costs more than my rent some months. Hey, peace of mind is priceless.

## Travel Insurance 

In additional to health insurance, it's wise for digital nomads to carry travel insurance when hopping around the world. These policies cover things like:

- Trip cancellation or interruption
- Lost baggage
- Flight delays
- Medical evacuation

Many credit cards include basic travel insurance when you purchase flights using the card. But for digital nomads constantly on the move, a dedicated travel insurance policy can provide more thorough coverage and give you extra peace of mind if things go sideways on the road.

I use and recommend World Nomads. For around $100 per month, they cover me for all the risks that crop up during non-stop travels. Last year when my flight to Greece was canceled due to strikes, World Nomads covered my hotel and rebooking fees without any hassle. Their 24/7 travel assistance is helpful too if any emergencies come up abroad.

## Housing Insurance

As a digital nomad living "on the road", traditional housing insurance may seem unnecessary. But if you have a home base somewhere, having homeowner's or renter's insurance can be wise to cover your possessions against risks like theft and natural disasters. 

Additionally, some travel insurance policies exclude coverage of personal belongings at a "home" address. So having a standalone housing policy can fill this gap if you maintain a home base and store valuables there between travels.

I still keep renter's insurance on my tiny San Francisco apartment which I crash at occasionally between travels. It covers all my stuff stored there, gives me liability protection, and also covers me for hotel stays and short-term rentals during my travels. For just $15 per month, it's worth it for the peace of mind.

## Long-Term Disability Insurance

One risk specific to digital nomads is having your income stream disrupted by an illness or injury that prevents you from working remotely as normal. Having long-term disability insurance can provide a monthly benefit if you're unable to work for an extended period.

I purchased an affordable policy that would pay me $2,000 per month if I'm unable to work for longer than 90 days. It's given me extra confidence to live this nomadic lifestyle knowing I have a backstop if anything happens that stops me from working remotely.

The key with insurance for digital nomads is balance. You want sufficient coverage to protect your finances if things go wrong. But not so much that premiums eat excessively into your income. With smart insurance choices, you can travel confidently knowing risks are covered and focus on the joy of the nomadic journey!
