# Banking 

When it comes to managing your finances on the road as a digital nomad, having the right bank accounts setup is crucial. Choosing the right bank and account options can save you time, money, and headaches as you globetrot. Here are some tips for optimizing your banking as a location-independent worker:

## Go With an Online Bank

Online banks that operate primarily through a website and mobile app tend to offer the most digital nomad-friendly services. Without physical branches, they provide 24/7 account access from anywhere and often have free or low-cost international ATM withdrawals. Top picks include Charles Schwab, Wise, and Capital One.

## Open an Account in Your Home Country 

It's a good idea to keep your primary bank account from your home country open while traveling abroad. This provides continuity for any auto-payments, direct deposits, etc. linked to that account. It also gives you a hub to easily receive wire transfers from employers.

## Get a No Foreign Transaction Fee Card

When selecting a debit and/or credit card, opt for ones that do not charge foreign transaction fees on international purchases. This avoids wasting money on fees every time you swipe your card abroad. Capitial One and some online banks offer good options here.

## Sign Up for a TransferWise (Wise) Account

Wise makes cheap, fast international money transfers. Getting a Wise account allows you to hold funds in multiple currencies, convert at low rates, and send/receive from all over the world. It's a must for digital nomads paid in different currencies.

## Research Local Bank Account Options

If settling in one place for an extended time, research getting a local bank account. This gives you easier access to the local currency and simpler logistics for paying rent, utilities, etc. Just be aware of account fees, language barriers, and transfer limits.

Proper banking setup takes some research upfront, but pays off hugely in facilitating a stress-free nomadic lifestyle. Follow these tips to handle your finances wisely on the road!
