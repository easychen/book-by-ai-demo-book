# Taxes

As a digital nomad, managing your taxes can be tricky. You may find yourself needing to file taxes in multiple countries, and figuring out exactly what you owe can be confusing. In this section, we'll walk through some of the key tax considerations for digital nomads.

## Determine Your Tax Residency 

The first step is figuring out where you are a tax resident. Some key factors in determining tax residency include:

- Where you spend the most time 
- Where you maintain your permanent home
- Your center of vital interests (i.e. your economic, family, and social ties)

Many countries use the 183 day rule - if you spend over 183 days in a country in a year, you are considered a tax resident. However, the rules vary by country, so be sure to research the specific laws.

As a U.S. citizen, you must file U.S. taxes no matter where you reside. You may also need to file taxes in your country of residence if you meet the residency requirements. 

## Double Taxation Treaties

If you end up being a tax resident of multiple countries, double taxation can occur. This means you pay tax on the same income twice. 

To prevent this, many countries have tax treaties, which outline which country has primary taxing rights. For example, under most treaties, the country where you perform services has priority in taxing employment income. 

Be sure to claim tax credits and exemptions available under these treaties. This will help minimize double taxation.

## Foreign Earned Income Exclusion

As a U.S. citizen or resident alien living abroad, you may be able to exclude up to $112,000 of foreign earned income from U.S. taxes by using the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. 

To qualify, you must meet one of the following:

- Bona fide residence test - live in a foreign country for an uninterrupted period that includes a full tax year

- Physical presence test - be physically present in a foreign country for at least 330 full days during a 12-month period

This exclusion can provide huge tax savings for digital nomads with foreign earned income.

## Self-Employment Tax

Many digital nomads work as freelancers or contractors, so you may need to pay self-employment tax. This consists of 15.3% tax on your net earnings to cover Social Security and Medicare.

Some countries have totalization agreements with the U.S. that may exempt U.S. citizens from U.S. self-employment tax.

## Foreign Tax Credits 

If you pay tax to a foreign country, you can claim a credit on your U.S. return for taxes paid. This helps avoid double taxation. 

There are limits imposed on the foreign tax credit to prevent it from zeroing out your U.S. tax liability. Make sure to calculate this properly when filing.

## State Taxes

Even if you live abroad, you may still need to file state tax returns if you have enough connection to a state. Factors like driver's license, voting registration, and property ownership tie you to a state.

Some states like California are aggressive about taxing former residents. Consider establishing residency in a state with no income tax before moving abroad.

## Choosing Where to Establish Residency

With smart planning, you may be able to legally avoid taxes by choosing where you establish residency. Here are some low tax countries popular with digital nomads:

- Cayman Islands 
- Monaco
- Singapore 
- Bahamas
- Bermuda

However, be wary of establishing residency somewhere solely for taxes. Tax authorities may see through this as tax avoidance.

## Final Tips

- Consult with a tax professional familiar with digital nomad taxes
- Maintain meticulous records of your travels  
- Research rules and use tax treaties to your advantage
- File all required tax returns on time

With some planning and preparation, you can master digital nomad taxes. The key is understanding the rules and making smart choices about where to live and work.
