# Boosting Productivity 

Productivity is the name of the game when it comes to succeeding as a remote worker. Without managers peering over your shoulder, it's up to you to structure your days productively and avoid procrastination. Luckily, there are some proven techniques you can use to maximize your efficiency when working solo. Let's go over some of the top tips for boosting productivity as a digital nomad.

## Establish Routines and Workflows

Like a surfer catching the tide, developing consistent daily routines will help you remain productive by capitalizing on momentum. Determine your peak hours of alertness and do focused work during those blocks. Dedicate other blocks to lower-energy tasks like admin work and email. 

Planning out workflows for common tasks also streamlines your process. For example, you could institute a Monday workflow for taking notes and synthesizing what you accomplished last week. Having an optimized workflow in place reduces mental startup costs each time you do important recurring tasks.  

## Remove Distractions 

Distractions are a remote worker's worst enemy. Without the ambient peer pressure of an office encouraging focus, it's easy to get sucked into rabbit holes. Use apps like Freedom or website blockers to limit access to common distractions like social media. Turn off notifications so you aren't constantly interrupted. Create a dedicated workspace clear of personal items as well.

## Take Intentional Breaks

While persistence is important, research shows that taking regular breaks improves productivity by helping you recharge mentally. Set a timer to remind yourself to take a 5-10 minute break every hour. Get outside for some fresh air, stretch your legs, or meditate. You’ll return to your work re-energized. Breaks are like lubricant for your brain’s gears – don’t neglect them!

## Track Metrics 

It’s easy to lose sight of progress when working independently. That’s why tracking metrics related to your goals keeps you motivated. For example, a writer could track daily word count. A programmer could track lines of code. Tracking progress reminds you that you are moving forward, even on tough days. Consider tracking with a kanban board or spreadsheet to visualize progress.

The key to succeeding as a digital nomad is being ruthlessly focused. Follow these tips to boost productivity and make the most of your precious time. The freedom of remote work is exhilarating, but remember that with great autonomy comes great responsibility.
