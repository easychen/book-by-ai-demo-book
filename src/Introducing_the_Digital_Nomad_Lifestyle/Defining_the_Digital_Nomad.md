# Defining the Digital Nomad

As technology continues to evolve and remote work becomes more mainstream, a new breed of worker is emerging - the digital nomad. But what exactly is a digital nomad? 

In simple terms, a digital nomad is someone who leverages technology to work remotely while traveling the world. They epitomize location independence and the freedom to live and work anywhere with an internet connection.

Unlike a standard remote worker who operates out of a home office, digital nomads are constantly on the move. They may spend a few weeks or months in one exotic destination before packing up and moving onto the next. Bali, Chiang Mai, Lisbon, Mexico City, and Medellin are popular digital nomad hot spots, but they may roam just about anywhere. 

Digital nomads may work at co-working spaces, coffee shops, beaches, or even on planes and trains. The key is having a portable income and a lifestyle not chained to a single physical location.

Many digital nomads start off as location independent freelancers or remote workers for companies based in their home countries. But as technology enables more roles to be done remotely, some are leaving corporate jobs altogether to pursue nomadic careers. 

According to MBO Partners' State of Independence report, there were 7.3 million independent workers in the U.S. in 2011. By 2018, that number grew to 41.1 million. And a Prudential study found that nearly 50% of American workers are freelancers. The digital nomad lifestyle is becoming increasingly appealing.

For Sue, a marketing manager turned nomadic social media consultant, the chance to work and travel was irresistible: 

"I was tired of the 9-to-5 grind and wanted the freedom to explore the world on my own schedule. Becoming a digital nomad has allowed me to visit over 30 countries in the past 5 years. I typically slow travel, staying in each destination for 2-3 months before moving onto the next. There are so many incredible places I never would have experienced if I stayed chained to an office."

Of course, the nomadic lifestyle does come with tradeoffs. Digital nomads give up the stability and community of an office. They have to handle challenges like finding decent WiFi, dealing with multiple timezones, maintaining routines, and battling loneliness on the road. 

But for those with an adventurous spirit, the pros of complete flexibility and location independence often outweigh the cons. The digital nomad movement will only continue gaining steam as more corporate roles go remote.
