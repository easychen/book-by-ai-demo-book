# Staying Social on the Road

For digital nomads, the thrill of traveling the world and having the freedom to live and work remotely can sometimes lead to unintended loneliness. When you're constantly on the move, making genuine connections and maintaining friendships takes effort. But staying social is a vital part of avoiding burnout. Humans are social creatures by nature, so we crave community and relationships. Keeping your social life active will help boost your mood, energy, creativity, and motivation.

## Why Staying Social Matters

It's easy to get caught up in work when you don't have coworkers chatting at the next desk over. Without a set routine, days can blur together. Over time, isolating yourself can take a toll on your mental health. Developing a support network helps ward off these risks. Here are some key reasons to make staying social a priority:

- Avoid depression and loneliness. Lack of social connections is linked to depression. Having face-time with others releases feel-good hormones.

- Reduce stress. Interacting with friends helps put your troubles in perspective. Laughing and relaxing lowers cortisol levels. 

- Stimulate creativity. Different perspectives spark new ideas. Friends can collaborate and brainstorm.

- Gain motivation and accountability. Social obligation creates healthy pressure to stick to goals. Others inspire and push you forward.

- Broaden your worldview. Experiencing new cultures with friends enhances the journey. Discussing varying viewpoints expands thinking.

## Tips for Meeting New People

While traveling, be proactive about making new connections:

### Join local meetup groups

Use websites like Meetup.com to find groups that match your interests. For example, join an expat group or a hiking club to meet like-minded locals. Showing up regularly helps form relationships.

### Stay at social hostels

Choose hostels that organize activities like communal meals, walking tours, game nights, and pub crawls. Backpacking lodges encourage mingling with other travelers.

### Chat up seat neighbors

Spark conversations on planes, trains, busses, etc. Long hauls are perfect for sharing stories and exchanging contact info.

### Befriend home-share hosts 

Using home-shares like CouchSurfing? Get to know the host personally for local insights. Ask about their life and interests.

### Strike up convos at coffeeshops

Cafes are ideal for striking up organic chats. Comment on someone's laptop sticker you like or ask what they're working on.

### Attend conferences and events

Look for relevant conferences nearby and attend networking mixers or parties. Tech events are full of like-minded professionals.

## Nurturing Existing Relationships

While making new connections is important, you should also nurture relationships with friends and family back home. This gives you an emotional anchor.

### Schedule video dates

Plan regular video calls to catch up face-to-face. Share meals together virtually. Video feels more personal than just texting or calling.

### Send postcards from your travels 

Mailing postcards allows you to share your experiences while showing loved ones you're thinking of them. Pick unique cards that capture the local culture.

### Collaborate on projects 

Work on passion projects with long-distance friends. For example, co-author a blog, develop an app, or record a podcast episode together.

### Meet up when possible 

If you'll be near friends, schedule meet-ups. Even a quick lunch lets you reconnect in person. When you're both traveling, pick a central place to rendezvous. 

### Share your adventures 

Post photos online to make others feel included in your journey. Bonus points for tagging friends directly when you visit spots they'd enjoy.

## Joining Digital Nomad Communities 

Surrounding yourself with fellow digital nomads alleviates loneliness and gives you a sense of belonging. You can lean on each other for support.

### Get to know nomads at your accommodations

Chat with digital nomads staying at your hotel, hostel, or rental. You likely have lots in common. Cook together, hit the town, or explore sights.

### Attend nomad meetups

Search sites like Meetup.com for digital nomad groups that host events in your area. This could be coffees, lunches, talks, or activities.

### Join Facebook groups

Search Facebook for digital nomad and location-based groups. For example, "Digital Nomads in Berlin" or "Paris Remote Workers".

### Use travel apps 

Apps like Tourlina, TripBuddy, and Backpackr connect you with other travelers. Meet up for drinks, discover events, find roomies, etc.

### Cowork at collaborative spaces 

Work alongside other nomads at communal coworking spaces. These facilitate networking and friendships between members.

### Go to nomad conferences

Conferences like Nomad Summit and DNX bring together nomads globally. Attend sessions, workshops, and social events.

## Balancing Social Life with Work

As with everything, moderation is key. Structure social time while remaining productive:

### Set work hours

Block off set work hours and keep evenings and weekends social. Communicate your schedule so friends know when you're available.

### Schedule social events 

Mark lunches, coffee dates, dinners, etc into your calendar so they don't fall by the wayside. Treat them as priorities, just like work meetings.

### Suggest making plans

Take the initiative to make specific plans with friends rather than vague "let's meet up sometime!" offers. Specifics breed commitment.

### Bring friends to coworking spots 

When you'll be engrossed in work anyway, have friends come to you. Buy them coffee in exchange for their company.

### Multitask leisure activities 

Do activities with friends that still allow you to work, like going to a cafe or compiling photos at home. 

### Take advantage of social opportunities

If you really click with people you meet, exchange info and make plans. Don't let busywork prevent making connections.

The digital nomad lifestyle allows incredible freedom and independence. But the joy comes from sharing the journey with others. By intentionally scheduling social time and joining communities, you'll avoid isolation. Stay social to recharge your enthusiasm and thrive.
